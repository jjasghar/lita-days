Sometimes your boss asks you how long it'll take you to do something. You might respond "90 days." This plugin'll allow you to come back
and figure out what you just committed too.

## Installation

Add lita-days to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-days"
```

## Configuration

None!

## Usage

Nice and simple:

```
user1> 90 days
bot> 2015-09-15 12:01:19 -0000
user1> 80 days
bot> 2015-09-05 12:02:19 -0000
user1> 100 days
bot> 2015-09-25 12:04:19 -0000

```
